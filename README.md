## Overview

Why virtual DOM needs to be only for actual DOM?
Logics like drawing formulas for canvas even needs DOM for easy way.

* **DOM based** ・・・The way that Web engineers can work most effectively.
* **jQuery like API** ・・・No more complex procedural webgl logics, just operate attributes with the API.
* **Web development friendly**・・・Use with the other Web frontend frameworks. Very easy to coop with them.
* **No more redundant codes**・・・Include  only the `tags` you actually need.

## Purpose

**WebGL is not only for games, but also for web services.**

After WebGL feature being implemented with modern browsers, many impressive Web3D libraries are appeared. However, most of them are just imported from 3D development culture that was grown in the environments very apart from web development culture.

There should be good way of mixing these cultures. Grimoire.js is one of solution of that future.
